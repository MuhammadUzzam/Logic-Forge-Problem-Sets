Approach (Optimized using Prefix and Suffix):

We avoid repeated multiplication by using prefix and suffix arrays.

Prefix array:
- pref[i] stores the product of all elements before index i

Suffix array:
- suff[i] stores the product of all elements after index i

Steps:
1. Build the prefix array from left to right
2. Build the suffix array from right to left
3. For each index i, multiply pref[i] and suff[i]
   This gives the product of all elements except contributions[i]

This method uses only linear passes.
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)
