Approach (Brute Force):

We want to find the product of all elements of the array except the current one.

For each index i:
- Start with a value temp = 1
- Loop over the entire array again
- Multiply all elements except when the index is i
- Store the result in the impact array

This method uses two loops, so for every element we scan the full array.
Time Complexity: O(n^2)
Space Complexity: O(n)
