Optimized Approach 

1. Use the fact that the matrix rows and columns are sorted.
2. Define a helper function count_before(mid) that counts how many elements are ≤ mid.
3. Use binary search between the smallest (matrix[0][0]) and largest (matrix[n-1][n-1]) element:
	-> If count of elements ≤ mid is less than k, search in the higher half.
	-> Otherwise, search in the lower half.
4. After binary search, low (or high) is the k-th smallest element.

Time Complexity: O(n log(max-min))
Space Complexity: O(1) extra space
