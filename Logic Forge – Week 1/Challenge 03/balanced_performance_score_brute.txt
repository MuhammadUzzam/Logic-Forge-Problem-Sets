Brute Force Approach

1. Combine both score lists (scoresA and scoresB) into one array.
2. Sort the combined array.
3. If total number of elements is odd, the median is the middle element.
4. If total number of elements is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements.

Time Complexity: O((n+m) log(n+m)) due to sorting
Space Complexity: O(n+m)
