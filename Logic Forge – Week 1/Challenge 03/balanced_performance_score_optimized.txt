Optimized Approach (Balanced Performance Score)

1. Use two pointers to traverse both sorted lists (scoresA and scoresB) simultaneously.
2. Keep track of the current and previous numbers while merging up to the middle position.
3. Stop as soon as we reach the median position:
4. If total elements are odd, median is the current number.
5. If even, median is average of current and previous numbers.

Time Complexity: O(n+m)
Space Complexity: O(1) extra space
