Brute Force Approach (Remove Invalid Parentheses / Longest Valid Substrings)

1. Generate all possible subsets of indices of the string s.
2. For each subset, check if it forms a valid parentheses sequence:
 	-> Use a stack to match opening '(' and closing ')'.
	-> If stack is empty at the end, the subset is valid.
3. Track the maximum length of valid subsets.
4. Collect all subsets that are valid and have this maximum length.
5. Convert the index subsets back to strings and remove duplicates using a set.
6. Print the set of all longest valid parentheses strings.

Time Complexity: O(2ⁿ × n) — because we check all subsets of length n
Space Complexity: O(2ⁿ × n) — to store all subsets
