Brute Solution (Generate All Subsets)
We generate all possible subsets of the array.
For every subset, we check its sum.
If any subset has sum = total_sum / 2, we return True.
If total sum is odd, equal partition is not possible.

Why slow?
Number of subsets = 2^n, so it becomes very slow for large arrays.
Time Complexity: O(2^n)
Space Complexity: O(2^n)
