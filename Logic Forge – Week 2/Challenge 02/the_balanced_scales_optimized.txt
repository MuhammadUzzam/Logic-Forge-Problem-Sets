Optimized Solution (Dynamic Programming)
First check if total sum is even.
Target becomes total_sum / 2.
dp[i][j] means:
Using first i elements, can we make sum j?
Two choices for each element:
Include it
Exclude it
Final answer is stored in dp[n][target].

Why fast?
Each state is calculated only once.
Time Complexity: O(n × sum)
Space Complexity: O(n × sum)
