Approach (Greedy)
Sort intervals by end time.
Keep track of en of last selected booking.
For each booking:
If start ≥ end → no overlap, select it, update end.
Else → overlap, cancel this booking, increment res.
res = minimum bookings to cancel.

Complexity
Time: O(n log n) (sorting)
Space: O(n) (for input list)
