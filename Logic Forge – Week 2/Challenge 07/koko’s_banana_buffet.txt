Approach (Binary Search)
Search space: lo = 1, hi = max(piles)
Check function func(x):
Compute hours needed with speed x:
hours = sum(ceil(pile / x) for pile in piles)
If hours <= k → speed x works.
Binary search:
If func(mid) is True → try smaller speed (hi = mid - 1)
Else → need larger speed (lo = mid + 1)
Keep track of minimum valid speed in res.

Complexity
Time: O(n log m) where m = max(piles)
Space: O(1) (only a few variables)
