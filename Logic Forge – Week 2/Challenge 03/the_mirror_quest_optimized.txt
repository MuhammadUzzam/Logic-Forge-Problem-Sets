Optimized Idea
A palindrome is same forward and backward.
Reverse the string.
Find LCS(original, reversed).
That LCS length = Longest Palindromic Subsequence.

How DP Works
func(n, m) = LCS of first n and m characters.
If characters match → 1 + func(n-1, m-1)
Else → max of skipping one character.
dp saves results to avoid recomputation.
Time: O(n²)
Space: O(n²)
