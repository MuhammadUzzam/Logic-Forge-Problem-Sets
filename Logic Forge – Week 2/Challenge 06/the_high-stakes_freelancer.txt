Approach (Greedy)
Pair each job as [profit, deadline].
Sort jobs in descending order of profit.
Keep track of:
cur = current day
prof = total profit
For each job:
If its deadline <= cur → cannot do, skip
Else → do it, add profit, increment cur
Return [number of jobs done, total profit].

Complexity
Time: O(n log n) (sorting)
Space: O(n) (job list)
